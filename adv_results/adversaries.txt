orig sent (1):	our flight arrived to vegas earlier than excepted , so we expected our room not to be ready when we arrived at the hotel on may 19th , the front desk girl offered us a room that was ready on the 28th floor that was n't facing the bellagio fountain i booked a corner view suite had requested a room on a high floor with a bellagio fountain view when i first made the reservation there are 56 floors at the hotel she then said there was a room on the 30th floor with a view of the bellagio fountain , but it was n't ready she continued to look for rooms , which she then said that there was a room on the 50th room with a bellagio fountain view , but it was n't ready yet either we agreed to wait for that room to be cleaned , which she said it would be couple of hours before it would be ready we waited a couple of hours by walking around the area before calling to check to see if the room was ready yet i was transferred to housekeeping , who said it was n't ready yet and they would call me back when it was after eating and walking around some more for a couple more hours without hearing back from anyone , we decided to go back to the hotel and was told that the room was ready it would of been nice if they had called me as they told me they would n nupon inspecting the room , we found a dirty fork and knife in the dishwasher , as well as trash in a trash can underneath the kitchen sink when housekeeping called to see if the utensils were delivered , which i requested upon check in and had been delivered , i told them about the trash and dirty utensils they said they would send someone up to take care of it no one ever showed up , so the trash and dirty utensils were left until the next day when housekeeping came to clean the room the room did have a great view of the fountain , strip , and mountains ! ! ! n non the evening of thursday may 20th , i called concierge to attempt to change reservation time for dinner at jean georges steakhouse at aria i held on the phone for 30 mins waiting for someone to answer , but no one ever did , so i hung up and decided to call the restaurant directly myself n nthe hotel is a nice hotel , which unlike some other reviewers , i feel that it is within a short walk to the bellagio , aria , the cosmopolitan , and the strip i would suggest going to the 24hr cvs , which is a short walk and is located a block south of citycenter on the strip to grab snacks and drinks , since the market inside the hotel has limited choices and closes at a certain time n nthe clark county fire station is located adjacent to the property they tend to stay busy , which on one of the late nights early morning hours , they seemed to respond to several calls in a span of 4 to 5 hours the windows are not sound proof , so you will hear the sirens , which may interrupt your sleep if you 're a light sleeper n nthe entire property is nice , which i would stay there again , especially with it being a non smoking non gaming hotel

orig sent (1):	i 've been craving thai for a few days , which is strange since vegas is like the thai food capital of the u s i 've surprisingly found my latest ventures to be less than stellar here , having wanted to try something other than the usual krung siam thai , lotus of siam , and archi 's one thing i 've concluded about thai in vegas is that , while still probably the best collection in the states , they are inconsistent i 've had great meals at krung thai , and then came back for a decidedly mediocre meal the next same experiences at archi 's , kung fu , and handful of others lotus of siam is consistently good , but consistently salty n nso my experiment continues , as i search for that go to place thai style noodle house was an utter failure , and pam real thai was very mediocre i saw arisra on yelp with only a handful of reviews , but for the most part good it appears the resto really took the time to post a lot of pictures also \( i suspect it was the restaurant , not the reviewers \) , both of which did n't give me a ton of comfort but what the heck , i was really in the mood for some crispy thai fish which i had n't had in forever , and this was a thai seafood restaurant , so i took the chance n nwe walked in at 4 30pm so as we expected it was empty the sign actually said they open at 5 pm , but they were happy to have us in very pleasant greetings , which continued throughout the meal the interior is not quite modern and not quite traditional , but not awkward either it felt cozy with modern ish furniture mixed in with some typical thai decor a stage sat at the corner , which i imagine is for a performer or karaoke typical to many thai restaurants i should go there during night time sometime n ni ordered a beer \( chang , no singha \) even though the thai mai tai sounded good i 'm thinking if the level 8 spicy we ordered on the spicy fried rice was burning hot , i can chug the beer not so much the mai tai we also order the crispy fish of the day \( sea bass , i think \) and bbq squid order takes some time they are not fast but what we receive looks very good with good presentation the squid is typical grilled squid , but comes with a sweet chili sauce on top and what looked and tasted like thai chili salsa like thing on the side both sauce were great , although the salsa thing was salty the fried rice was good and the fish was great definitely satisfied the craving , and just what i was hoping for with super crispy skin and sweet chili sauce neither were very salty as well 3 5 stars for the squid and rice , 4 5 for the fish so it 's a qualified 4 stars on food n ncombine that with a cozy atmosphere , some live music \( not while we were there \) , and pleasant service and we have a solid 4 stars i will definitely be coming here again because they have the most extensive seafood dishes i 've seen at a thai restaurant including about half dozen fish dishes , and i want to try more of them it will also give me a chance to see if they meet my consistency test n ntable for 1 factor it was perfectly fine while i was there , but i wonder if it will be different during busy time \? as it was , there should be no awkwardness eating alone

the fancier the decor in an ethnic restaurant , the blander the food n nstated differently , what is it about the mystical siren 's call of the hole in the wall ethnic restaurant \? does the chef assume that because his food is head and shoulders above the rest that he need n't waste money on decorations \? or is it simply that the mom pop chef with his traditional recipes handed down from generation to generation will never be matched by the cookie cutter american culinary school education \? n nthis restaurant is very unassumedly named the middle eastern bakery and deli , though it is also a restaurant and grocery store it does n't look like much from the outside , nor the inside , and would probably fly under most people 's radar if it was not for word of mouth passed through yelp can you see the diamond lurking under the layer of carbon \? i sure can n nthe proprietor , isam \( yes , we 're on a first name basis now and you will be , too , by the end of your first visit \) , is quite a character guaranteed to put a smile on the face of even the worst sourpuss before our first visit we called him by phone to make sure the restaurant would be open when we arrived and he was friendly and welcoming when we finally arrived he welcomed us like old friends n ni ordered the grilled combo and my coworker ordered the lebanese chicken both plates came with a choice of greek salad of tabbouli with a fresh warm pita and rice i was n't sure which to choose , so isam guided me gently toward the tabbouli which he makes fresh 5 times every day yes , you can tell this man is incredibly gifted in the making of tabbouli , which is a thing of beauty , colorfully decorated with red and green pepper rings , white couscous , tangy red tomato , crisp white onions , and ruby toned sliced beets over dark greens it is beautiful , but tastes even better i ordered a diet soda in spite of the prominently displayed yelp tip recommending the lemonade \( your life will change as you discover the super powers you 've acquired from the lemonade \) as i 'm not usually a big lemonade fan my coworker ordered the lemonade and i ordered the birds nest baklava with glistening green pistachio pieces covering the top to eat while i waited for the food to arrive n nmy coworker took one sip of the lemonade , which is made with honey and rose water sheer genius and could n't stop talking about how amazing it was i traded him half of my baklava for a taste and could n't believe how amazing it was truly life changing isam brought me a large cup of this elixir of the gods and made my entire day n nwhen our meals came i was thrilled with my perfectly seasoned kebabs with three kinds of meat chicken , lamb , and spiced ground beef , all of them cooked perfectly and all of them delicious the rice was not basmati , more like a pilaf , but was incredibly flavorful alex said his lebanese chicken was amazing , but refused to share any with me n nthe owner brought us over a complimentary turkish coffee , a lemonade , and a pistachio baklava all amazing ! ! ! isam also gave us a lesson in appreciating coffee he taught us how to sip it and about his secret ingredient \( cardamom \) he grinds his own cardamom fresh from the seeds , which cost 100 per pound and i guarantee you are totally worth the expense he showed us both the seeds and the ground versions and let us smell them , pure heaven on earth isam says that the cardamom works on your nervous system to relax you i certainly felt relaxed when i left , but i think some of that might have to do with the owner 's charm rather than the coffee when we left , we stopped up at the counter to say goodbye to our host , because it just felt more like a family visit than a restaurant visit you can just walk out of a restaurant , but you do n't walk out on family without saying goodbye n ni made a return visit several days later and not only did isam remember me , but he came out from behind the counter to give me a hug and asked where my friend was \( i had just dropped my coworker off at the airport \) i ordered the lebanese chicken and one of his heavenly lemonades isam once again brought me a turkish coffee \( this stuff is addicting \) and a baklava to enjoy with it i enjoyed my second visit as much as my first isam gave me a menu and invited me to come back again during my visit he even gave me his phone number and told me to call if i needed anything n ni will definitely be back ! ! n n n n n n relaxes you , works on your nervous syst
